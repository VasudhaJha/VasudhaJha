# Hi, I'm Vasudha Jha! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a DevOps and Cloud Engineer passionate about building scalable, efficient systems and automating workflows to solve real-world problems.

## 🌟 About Me

My journey started as a full-stack developer, building web and mobile applications, but I found myself drawn to automation, cloud scalability, and making deployments smoother. That led me to DevOps and Cloud Engineering, where I now focus on building reliable infrastructure, optimizing workflows, and automating deployments.

Right now, I’m hands-on with AWS, Terraform, CI/CD pipelines, Docker and Ansible, working on projects that deepen my understanding of cloud automation and scalable infrastructure. I have found that the best way to learn is by building real things, debugging, and iterating along the way.

## 🚀 Fun Projects I'm Working On

- [AWS Cloud Resume Challenge](https://github.com/VasudhaJha/aws-cloud-resume-challenge): Building a serverless resume website with Terraform-provisioned resources, CI/CD pipelines, and a focus on scalability and automation. Here's the [challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/), if you want to take it!
- [Step-by-Step Ansible](https://github.com/VasudhaJha/step-by-step-ansible): Writing a structured hands-on guide to Ansible, from beginner to advanced concepts. Creating real-world automation tasks to improve infrastructure management.
